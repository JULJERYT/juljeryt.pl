when i started my ‚Äúadventure‚Äù with computers i used my grandmas laptop which had windows 7. later my dad gave me his old laptop which had windows 8 (i upgraded it to windows 10). and now i have my computer which has windows 11.

well, windows 11

from the beginning after installing this system something didnt feel right to me

![bloated windows 11 start menu](/assets/media/i-use-arch-btw/win11-start-menu.jpg)

<style>
  img[alt="bloated windows 11 start menu"] { width: 500px; }
</style>

when i saw this, i thought

> _"what the fuck microsoft? why is there picsart, twitter, netflix and other shit preinstalled on a clean install of windows"_ ~julek 2024

on top of that:

too strict hardware requirements

- built-in trackers
- you need to log in to your microsoft account
- you cant uninstall edge without destroying your system
- annoying context menu
- and much more
- yet somehow i lived with it - until today

when i heard that windows 11 will introduce ‚Äúrecall‚Äù feature that will take screenshot every few seconds and send it the fuck knows where

i said **enough**

and thats how i decided to move to linux

<hr>

however, i didnt choose distribution for noobs like linux mint, ubuntu, fedora etc

i chose...
<span class="hidden-text" id="hidden-text">arch linux!!! (i feel the pain)</span>
<audio id="sound-effect" src="/assets/media/i-use-arch-btw/yay.mp3"></audio>

so i get up in the morning i plug the usb with the arch into my computer and install it (i used `archinstall` command, because im not a masochist to install it manually)

once the arch was installed i started discovering what programs are preinstalled

i couldnt believe my eyes

the only software ive found were settings, some kind of text editor, file explorer, console and some other system software like emoji selector

there wasn't even a preinstalled browser

it was such an awesome feeling

<hr>

this is how my desktop looks like:

<summary>how to disable webcam system-wide</summary>

as i also have a laptop on which i have arch installed i didnt want someone to watch me while i was being hacked (i know its better to put a tape on the camera but im afraid of breaking something lmao)

on windows i could just go into the device manager and disable webcam
on linux just use this simple command:

```shell
echo 'blacklist uvcvideo' | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf && sudo rmmod uvcvideo
```

this command adds the module that handles webcam to the blacklist and disables it

<summary>how to solve the problem with installing some applications using the linux-hardened kernel</summary>
i love to have the feeling that i have a well-secured system, so i use linux-harnened kernel

unfortunately using it i encountered a problem with installing/launching some applications (such as browser or vsc)

after an hour of searching the internet i found the answer on github ([link](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4107#issuecomment-2424099343))

```shell
sudo sysctl kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1
```

well, if you want to be safe, you sometimes have to spend (a lot of) time solving problems

<summary>my customization setup</summary>

i use kde plasma 6, so i have a lot of options for customizing the system
heres my setup:

colors & themes:

global theme - install win11os-dark (click get new, search it and install) but do not apply it, instead apply 

breeze dark (we will use win11os-dark later)

application style - breeze

plasma style - win11os-dark (it should appear after installing it as global theme)

window decorations - willow dark (no blur, alt or shaders just willow dark)

icons - kora

cursor - bibata-modern-ice

system sounds - ocean

splash screen - kuro the cat (i love cats btw)

login screen (sddm) - suave dark

windows management > desktop effects > blur > set blur strenght in the middle and noise strenght left as far as possible
