# jul's website
hi, jul here!

inspired by [this website](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/) im rewriting my website from scratch in vanilla html css and js* **just like in good old days** - no tailwind, no nextjs, no nuxt, no astro, no svelte, no remix, no vue, no hugo, no jekyll, no react, no bootstrap, no vite, no webpack, no fancy shi

i also want this site to:
- be **responsive**
- **not** make requests to **external cdn's and servers** and when it is necessary display a warning
- have a **transparent cards theme**

for the current moment ive decided to remove my blog, maybe i will bring it back in the future

*javascript will be used very little, only for some easter eggs, animated <title> and basic stuff.
<br>
it will **NEVER** be required to browse my website, i respect decision of users who have blocked scripts in their browser
